# My First C Project

👋 My name is Ian Brown and this is a space where I write some of my first C code.  
👨‍🏫 Feel free to take the same lessons that I have from it. I will try to provide as much documentation as I can!  
🧐 The goal of this project is to get me ready as an Embedded Software Developer. I hope to make lots of C, C++ programs for microcontrollers. 

Here on out:
- 👨‍🏫 indicates a mentor or tutorial.
- 🧐 are questions or prompts.

## Table of Contents

- [Source and Header Files](#sources)
- [Support](#support)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Cited](#citations)

## Todo

- [x] Pointers
- [x] Headers
- [x] File I/O, Creation, and Manipulation
- [x] String Reverses, Safety, and Manipulation
- [x] Macros
- [x] Buffers
- [ ] Structs

## Sources

A `source.c` file `#includes` a `header.h` file.   
A `header.h` file essentially provides abstract classes to be included in the `source.c` files.  
This | Incorporates | included Functions
------------ | ------------- | -------------
source.c | header.h | function()

Source File | Header File | Functions
------------ | ------------- | -------------
main.c | main.h | all subsequent listings.
pointerPractice.c | pointerPractice.h | pointerPractice, pointerArrays

## Support

I cannot and will *not* help people with questions regarding the code. **However**, please feel free to check out the citations. The purpose of this work is to how what and how I learned. 

## Contributing

I am the only developer involved in this work.

## Citations

Here I will try to include source I used and/or would suggest for learning c. 

`Note: All code in this project is mine, however it may be based on code from elsewhere.`
